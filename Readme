Olympic Data Analytics - Azure End-to-End Data Engineering Project
This project leverages the Microsoft Azure data stack to ingest, process, analyze, and visualize Olympic Games data using a modern data engineering pipeline. The architecture supports scalability, performance, and real-time analytics, transforming raw data into actionable insights.
Architecture Overview
The data pipeline consists of the following stages:
1.	Data Integration using Azure Data Factory (ADF).
2.	Raw Data Storage in Azure Data Lake Gen 2.
3.	Data Transformation with Azure Databricks.
4.	Processed Data Storage in Azure Data Lake Gen 2.
5.	Analytics & Querying through Azure Synapse Analytics.
6.	Visualization and Dashboarding using Power BI, Looker Studio, and Tableau.

Project Workflow
1. Data Ingestion
•	Tool: Azure Data Factory (ADF)
•	Description: ADF extracts raw data from various sources (e.g., databases, APIs, files). The data is then loaded into Azure Data Lake Gen 2 for storage.
2. Raw Data Storage
•	Tool: Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2
•	Description: Acts as a scalable storage system for unstructured and structured data. This is where raw Olympic data is initially stored.
3. Data Transformation
•	Tool: Azure Databricks
•	Description:
o	Perform data cleansing, transformations, and aggregations using Apache Spark within Azure Databricks.
o	The transformed data is stored back in Azure Data Lake Gen 2 for further analysis.
4. Data Analytics
•	Tool: Azure Synapse Analytics
•	Description:
o	Azure Synapse is used for data warehousing and complex queries.
o	Processed data from Azure Data Lake Gen 2 is loaded into Synapse, where advanced analytics and big data processing are performed.
5. Visualization & Reporting
•	Tools: Power BI, Looker Studio, Tableau
•	Description:
o	The insights derived from the processed data are visualized using popular business intelligence tools like Power BI, Looker Studio, and Tableau.
o	Dashboards present key Olympic metrics such as medal counts, athlete performance, and event statistics.
